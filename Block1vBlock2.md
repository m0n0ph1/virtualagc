## Introduction ##

The "block 1" AGC used in unmanned Apollo missions, and which would have been used for the Apollo 1 mission, is very similar to the "block 2" AGC used in all of the manned missions.  But it also differs in a number of details that affect programs written for the block 1 computers, as well as the implementation of the assembler and CPU simulator.  The block 1 DSKY is also quite different in physical appearance from the block 2 DSKY.

This wiki page is intended to described all of the differences in adequate detail to guide implementation changes in the Virtual AGC yaYUL, yaAGC, and yaDSKY(2) programs, as well as to provide guidance for a programmer familiar with block 2 systems to write block 1 programs.


## Documentation for Consultation ##

  * Language definition:
    * AGC3 language, which preceded the AGC4 computer used for Block 1 and Block 2, is defined in document [E-1077](http://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/NARA-SW/E-1077.pdf).
    * Block 1 machine language is defined in document [R-393](http://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/hrst/archive/1008.pdf).
    * Block 2 machine language is defined in [Memo #9](http://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/hrst/archive/1689.pdf), as supplemented by the [AGC4 Basic Training Manual](http://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/NARA-SW/E-2052.pdf).

## Differences Between Block I and Block II Basic Assembly Language ##

At the source level, the Block I basic language is essentially a subset of the Block II basic language, with a few exceptions.

The common instructions (at the source-code level) between Block 1 and Block 2 are:  AD, CAF, CCS, COM, CS, DEC, DOUBLE, DV, EXTEND, INDEX, INHINT, MASK, MP, NDX, NOOP, OVIND, OVSK, RELINT, RESUME, RETURN, SQUARE, SU, TC, TCR, TCAA, TS, and XCH.  The entire set of i/o channel instructions from Block 2 (such as READ, WRITE, ROR, WOR, RAND, WAND, etc.) is missing from Block 1, since the Block 1 computer uses a memory-mapped i/o system rather than having a separate i/o address space.

Note, however, that some of the exceptional instructions which have been assigned special meanings or given special shorthand mnemonics are not quite the same between Block I and Block II, as follows:

| **Shorthand Mnemonic** | **In Block 1** | **In Block 2** | **Comment** |
|:-----------------------|:---------------|:---------------|:------------|
| BBCON                  | (missing)      | OCT 66100      |             |
| COM                    | CS A           | CS A           |             |

| DDOUBL                 | (missing)      | DAS A          |             |
| DOUBLE                 | AD A           | AD A           |             |
| DTCB                   | (missing)      | DXCH Z         |             |
| DTCF                   | (missing)      | DXCH 4         |             |
| EXTEND                 | INDEX 5777     | TC 6           | Additionally, the programmer is expected to have preloaded address 5777 with the value 47777. |
| INHINT                 | INDEX 17       | TC 4           |             |
| NOOP                   | XCH A          | (depends on memory region) |             |
| OVSK                   | TS A           | TS A           |             |
| RELINT                 | INDEX 16       | TC 3           |             |
| RESUME                 | INDEX 25       | INDEX 17       |             |
| RETURN                 | TC Q           | TC Q           |             |
| SQUARE                 | MP A           | MP A           |             |
| TCAA                   | TS Z           | TS Z           |             |
| XAQ                    | TC A           | (missing)      |             |
| XLQ                    | (missing)      | TC L           |             |
| XXALQ                  | (missing)      | TC A           |             |
| ZL                     | (missing)      | LXCH 7         |             |
| ZQ                     | (missing)      | QXCH 7         |             |

In general, the differences in the table above wouldn't be significant _if_ the shorthand mnemonics were always used, since the assembler would automatically substitute the correct equivalent.  In very old code, however, one sometimes sees forms like INDEX 17 used directly rather than the short-form INHINT (in Block 1) or RESUME (in Block 2), and in these cases Block 1 code would not run as expected on a Block 2 AGC, or vice-versa.

Though basically forward-compatible at the source-code level, various instructions assemble to different binary machine-code in Block 1 than in Block 2.  We won't elaborate those differences here, since you can find them in the linked reference documents.  This is usually a matter of complete indifference, since the assembler will substitute the correct binary values.  _However_, there is one case in which it is important, and that is the case in which the coder has essentially hand-assembled the code and provides numerical values for the opcodes in place of the normal mnemonics.  This is sometimes seen in very old code, where you might see an instruction like

```
        3       VARIABLE
        # In Block 1 this is the same as
        XCH     VARIABLE
        # In Block 2 this is the same as
        CA      VARIABLE
```

As far as pseudo-ops are concerned, we can't really be sure what the complete set of supported pseudo-ops is for Block 1, since there is no document that defines them.  (Indeed, this is even partially true for Block 2, since a few pseudo-ops appearing in actual Block 2 source code are not defined in any known document.)  The only large example of Block 1 code which is presently accessible is the Apollo 4 program, Solarium 55.  In examining Solarium 55, we conclude that with one exception the Block 1 pseudo-ops are a compatible but greatly reduced subset of Block 2 pseudo-ops, as follows:  =, 2DEC, 2DEC`*`, 2OCT, ADRES, BANK, CADR, DEC, EQUALS, ERASE, OCT, OCTAL, SETLOC.  Note that the Block 1 memory space had no "super-banks" (fixed-memory banks 40, 41, 43, and 43), so there was no need for any pseudo-ops like SBANK whose essential purpose was to deal with super-banks.

The exception mentioned above is that Block 1 has a pseudo-op XCADR which does not exist in Block 2.  The purpose of XCADR is TBD.

## Interpreter-Language Differences ##

Block 1 and Block 2 interpreter languages are identical in syntax, but only partially overlap in terms of the opcodes they supply.  At present, there is no known documentation for the Block 1 interpreter language, so some of the information in the table below is based on inspection of the Block 1 Solarium 55 program, and on the definition of AGC3 interpreter language, which preceded and was obsoleted by Block 1. It is therefore possible that some instructions which are marked as unsupported are actually supported by the simulation; however, they are _not_ supported by the modern assembler.

Though there is a certain compatibility at the source-code level implied by the table above, at the binary level the interpreter source assembles to different code.  One difference in particular is that when two interpreter opcodes are packed into a single memory word, seven bits for each, the order of the packing is swapped.  These binary differences are generally irrelevant to the coder, since coders never hand-assemble interpreter code.

## I/O Differences ##

(Block I used registers for I/O while Block II used channels; this should be described here.)


## Other Memory-Map Differences ##

  * TIME1 and TIME2 variables (according to John Pultorak):
    * Block 1:  TIME1 is at the lower address.
    * Block 2:  TIME1 is at the higher address.

  * Program start and interrupt-vector table (according to John Pultorak):
    * Block 1:  Program start is address 2000 and remainder of interrupt vectors begin at 2004.
    * Block 2:  Program start (GOPROG) is at address 4000 and the remainder of the interrupt vectors begin at 4004.
